 *
 * A custom `durationThreshold` configuration option can optionally be passed to
 * control what `event-timing` entries are considered for INP reporting. The
 * default threshold is `40`, which means INP scores of less than 40 are
 * reported as 0. Note that this will not affect your 75th percentile INP value

 * additional callbacks once the user has backgrounded a
 * page](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/page-lifecycle-api/#advice-hidden),

 * hidden. As a result, the `callback` function might be called multiple times
