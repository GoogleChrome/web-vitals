 * Calculates the [CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls) value for the current page and
 * calls the `callback` function once the value is ready to be reported, along
 * with all `layout-shift` performance entries that were used in the metric
 * value calculation. The reported value is a `double` (corresponding to a
 * [layout shift score](https://web.dev/articles/cls#layout_shift_score)).
 *
 * If the `reportAllChanges` configuration option is set to `true`, the
 * `callback` function will be called as soon as the value is initially
 * determined as well as any time the value changes throughout the page
 * lifespan.
 *
 * _**Important:** CLS should be continually monitored for changes throughout
 * the entire lifespan of a pageâ€”including if the user returns to the page after
 * it's been hidden/backgrounded. However, since browsers often [will not fire
 * additional callbacks once the user has backgrounded a
 * page](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/page-lifecycle-api/#advice-hidden),
 * `callback` is always called when the page's visibility state changes to
 * hidden. As a result, the `callback` function might be called multiple times
 * during the same page load._
